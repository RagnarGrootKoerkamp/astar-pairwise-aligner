Here are some other algorithms visualized:

|---------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------|
| Ukkonen's exponential band algorithm (Ukkonen'85)             | [[file:imgs/fig1/1_ukkonen.gif]]               |
| Dijkstra's algorithm                                          | [[file:imgs/fig1/2_dijkstra.gif]]              |
| Diagonal transition (Ukkonen'85, Myers'86, WFA)               | [[file:imgs/fig1/3_diagonal_transition.gif]]   |
| Diagonal transition with divide and conquer (Myers'86, BiWFA) | [[file:imgs/fig1/4_dt-divide-and-conquer.gif]] |
| A* with chaining seed heuristic and pruning (A*PA, this work) | [[file:imgs/fig1/5_astar-csh-pruning.gif]]     |

And here is another one:

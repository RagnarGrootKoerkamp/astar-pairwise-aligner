Here are some competitor algorithms:

1. Ukkonen's exponential band algorithm (Ukkonen'85)
   [[file:imgs/fig1/1_ukkonen.gif][Ukkonen]]
2. Dijkstra's algorithm
   [[file:imgs/fig1/2_dijkstra.gif][Dijkstra]]
3. Diagonal transition (Ukkonen'85, Myers'86, WFA)
   [[file:imgs/fig1/3_diagonal_transition.gif][Diagonal transition]]
4. Diagonal transition with divide and conquer (Myers'86, BiWFA)
   [[file:imgs/fig1/4_dt-divide-and-conquer.gif][Diagonal transition with divide and conquer]]
5. A* with chaining seed heuristic and pruning (A*PA, this work)

And here is another one:

* Current state

Currently we're in the process of adding visualizations and linking to external (WFA, Edlib) libraries.
We will put them behind feature flags soon, so that compiling just those repository works again.

If you would like to try out A*PA, please make an issue here as soon as you run into any kind of problems or unclarity
-- writing documentation is pending, but we're happy to help you out.

* Getting started

1. Install [[https://rustup.rs/][rustup]].
1. Install Rust Nightly using ~rustup install nightly~
1. Make it the default: ~rustup default nightly~
1. Run tests in [[src/lib.rs]] using ~cargo test [name_of_test]~
